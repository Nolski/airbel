      Coach Erevu begins with the goal to: “design a flexible and durable
      learning and teaching experience that dramatically improves a child’s
      acquisition of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and literacy in their
      primary school years”
---

#### Why focus on Social-emotional learning?

Social-emotional learning, or “SEL”, can help children develop the skills needed to regulate their emotional responses, positively interact with others and better persevere in adverse situations.

####  

#### How does it work?

* Coaching sessions and peer-to-peer learning occur during 1-hour weekly video clubs.
* Refugee teachers implement what they learned in their classroom during daily designated ‘SEL time,’ marked by a school bell.
* Teachers are rewarded and supported with localized SEL cards that signal they are skilled SEL teachers and can be used as teaching aids in the classroom.
