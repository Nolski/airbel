      The aim is to “Design a flexible and durable learning and teaching
      experience that dramatically improves a child’s acquisition of Social and
      Emotional Learning (SEL) and literacy in their primary school years”
---

In Spark, youth leaders create alternative learning spaces outside of school. This concept is focused on delivering Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and literacy in focused, small groups led by educated youth. Sparks can exist as an extension of school and involve teachers or be completely separate from it. It will mark student accomplishments, involve parents in the learning process and conclude with a celebration at the end of each learning cycle.

Youth Sparks are trained and supported with materials to lead learning circles. Spark Backpacks contain materials, lessons and activities for use in the learning circles. Student Learning Circles are led by youth Sparks and teach literacy and SEL in concentrated and interactive small group sessions. Civic Camp is where parents and other community members learn about the Spark program, literacy and SEL. Spark Carnival is a community event where the progress and learning of the students is celebrated.
