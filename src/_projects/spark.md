Student Learning Circles are led by youth Sparks, who are equipped to teach literacy and SEL in concentrated and interactive small group sessions. Youth sparks receive Spark Backpacks with materials, lessons and activities for use in the learning circles, and the youth leaders are well-trained in their use. Sparks can exist as an extension of school and involve teachers or be completely separate from it. Parents and community members are involved in the learning process, and have ample opportunities to learn about the program, literacy, and SEL. Through Spark Carnival, student accomplishments are celebrated with the whole community.
