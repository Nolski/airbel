  Developed in partnership with Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab,
  the placement algorithm suggests an ideal resettlement location for refugees.
  By being able to take in reams more data than a human alone, the algorithm can
  aid IRC’s experienced staff to place refugees where they are most likely to
  integrate and succeed.

      Due to lower resettlement numbers in the U.S., the IRC and Stanford’s IPL
      decide to approach two other resettlement agencies, Lutheran Immigration
      and Refugee Service and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops,
      and develop a proposal to implement the algorithm across multiple
      agencies. Stanford begins designing the portal staff that the agencies
      will use.

Developed in partnership with Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab, the placement algorithm analyzes historical data, labor market conditions, demographics, refugee preferences and other factors to suggest an ideal location for resettled refugees. The data-driven process is complementary to the extensive work of case workers and to the years of resettlement experience of the International Rescue Committee.

This algorithm is part of a larger enterprise aimed at creating a new global model for refugee resettlement, with the goal of ultimately increasing the number of refugees countries take in and the quality of resettlement programming.
