      Due to lower resettlement numbers in the U.S., the IRC and Stanford’s IPL
      decide to approach two other resettlement agencies, Lutheran Immigration
      and Refugee Service and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops,
      and develop a proposal to implement the algorithm across multiple
      agencies. Stanford begins designing the portal staff that the agencies
      will use.

      Matching becomes one of the cornerstones of how we pitch a “global

      Stanford completes a backtest of the algorithm on IRC data, and the

      doubling of employment at 90 days for resettled refugees.

Moving somewhere new is challenging under the best circumstances. This is especially true for refugees, who are driven from their homes by conflict or other major threats, and often have little choice in where they end up. Caseworkers play a critical role in helping settle refugees in new places, and the International Rescue Committee has many years of experience helping to get refugees settled.

The community where refugees are placed is generally dictated by need and availability. But data shows what common sense states: different people are likely to succeed in different circumstances. Enter the placement algorithm - a collaboration between Stanford and the Airbel Center. The algorithm analyzes historical data, labor market conditions, demographics, refugee preferences and other factors to suggest an ideal location for resettled refugees. This actionable information can then be used to make decisions about where to place refugees around the world.&nbsp;

This algorithm is part of a larger enterprise aimed at creating a new global model for refugee resettlement. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of refugees countries take in, as well as improve the quality of resettlement programming.
