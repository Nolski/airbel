  Using machine learning to predict the communities where resettled refugees are
  most likely to thrive
status: active
stage: 3. Design / Solution Generation
description: >-
  Developed in partnership with Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab,
  the placement algorithm suggests an ideal resettlement location for refugees.
  By being able to take in reams more data than a human alone, the algorithm can
  aid IRC’s experienced staff to place refugees where they are most likely to
  integrate and succeed.

Developed in partnership with Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab, the placement algorithm analyzes historical data, labor market conditions, demographics, refugee preferences and other factors to suggest an ideal location for resettled refugees. The data-driven process is complementary to the extensive work of resettlement case workers and to the IRC's years of resettlement experience. This algorithm is part of a larger enterprise aimed at creating a new global model for refugee resettlement with the goal to ultimately increase the number of refugees host countries take in and the quality of resettlement programming.
