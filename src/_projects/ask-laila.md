Refugees have many questions and can struggle to access the answers in a concise and accessible fashion. The most vulnerable groups, such as women and people with mental illness, may not be comfortable asking certain questions in more traditional casework contexts. Ask Laila was conceived to address this challenge - providing clients with a hotline where they could call in to connect with a trusted local source in their own language. Ask Laila also included text messages and a Facebook group where refugees can connect with one another.
