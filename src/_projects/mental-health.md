A growing body of research points to the outsized impact of mental health issues in the refugee population. Common mental health disorders like anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder tend to double during emergencies, and tend to impact the most vulnerably most powerfully. Mental health issues and poverty also form a self-reinforcing cycle which can make it challenging for people to rebuild after facing trauma.

Most refugees live in low-income countries, where only 2 percent of health providers are trained in mental health. In Jordan, even prior to the Syria crisis, the WHO estimated that the country faced a shortage of well over 1,000 mental health professionals. Mental illness remains a taboo with significant cultural barriers to identifying challenges and seeking care.

Some key areas in which support can be provided includes:

* Basic services and security, including food, shelter and access to clean water.
* Community and family support, such as family reunification, creation of child friendly spaces, and activation of social networks.
* Focused non-specialized support, such as individual, family or group interventions, and ongoing care through community-based primary health care systems.
* Specialized services, including clinical mental health care and specialized support for psychiatric disorders and trauma.

There is increasing evidence that “non-specialist workers in primary-care and community settings can deliver mental health care with great effectiveness to a variety of populations.”. Therefore, opportunities for innovation may exist around:

1. Standardizing outcomes and developing culturally sensitive assessment tools;
2. Better articulating core principles for integrating mental health in various activities, such as social connections, exercise, and mindfulness; and
3. Developing new business models to incentivize community members to effectively deliver mental health support.
