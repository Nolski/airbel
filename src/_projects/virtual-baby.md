      * Conducted expert interviews and desk reviews to understand the potential
      for impact on SAM treatment and cost at scale of innovations in SAM
      prevention being spearheaded by members of the No Wasted Lives Coalition

      * Developed a model to analyze interactions between innovations under
      various scenarios with input from nutrition experts (users can manipulate
      the model to change assumptions as they like)

Virtual baby game teaches children about nutrition and family planning, bringing these crucial health messages into their household. The game is targeted to children between the ages of 7 and 15. It would create a new entry point for family planning and nutrition information to enter households through adolescents - many of whom are caregivers and soon to become parents.

The game would be played on a simple pocket-sized device with a digital screen and a few buttons that does not require charging. Gameplay would center around raising strong babies, selecting options that could strengthen or weaken the baby’s mind or happiness. The game would also measure the parents’ energy to illustrate the effects of poor birth-spacing and eating on both mother and baby.

Virtual baby would test the ability of “gamified” practices to improve uptake of messages around sexual and reproductive health and nutrition, helping girls plan for pregnancy and care for siblings and future children.
