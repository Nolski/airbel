Available funding is not enough to meet the world’s vast needs for aid. When crises strike or intensify, humanitarian actors must lose precious time mobilizing funding. This means humanitarian response is often not just too little, but too late.

Displacement insurance would help host countries, NGOs, and donors provide life-saving assistance quickly and effectively. Just like homeowners’ insurance, displacement insurance would provide the holders with payouts when triggered. For a homeowner, the trigger might be damage caused during a storm or flood. Displacement insurance would be triggered by events such as a large increase in refugees, or the onset of conflict. Aid providers would then receive a payout to be used providing swift and quality services to people in need.

Currently, Airbel is working with the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development to better understand the market for such a product. This research could lead to a groundbreaking, innovative and lifesaving redesign of humanitarian crisis response funding.
