  Displacement insurance aims to make humanitarian aid more agile. As crises
  occur, these policies could disperse capital to host countries, NGOs, or other
  key actors to take swift, live-saving action.

The world currently faces an unprecedented scale of need for aid, and is now facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II. Although funding is at an all-time high it still cannot meet the world’s vast needs for aid. Currently, when needs increase or a crisis strikes, humanitarian actors must mobilize funding, losing precious time and energy. This means humanitarian responses is often not just too little, but also too late.

Displacement insurance would insure host countries, NGOs, and donors against crises, such as rare large-scale influxes in refugees or the outbreak of conflict that could prove difficult to respond to. This would help allow for more timely and effective response to save lives. Just like homeowners’ insurance, this insurance would provide the holders with payouts should a crisis occur. While for a homeowner, this might be a storm or flood, displacement insurance would be triggered by events such as a large increase in refugees, or the onset of conflict. When triggered, the insurance would provide the aid provider and/or host country a payout, enabling them to provide swift and quality services to people in need.

Currently, Airbel is working with DFID to conduct a feasibility assessment is being to understand the market for such a product. Airbel and DFID are co-organizing a refugee finance innovation lab for discussion with key stakeholders. Our research could lead to a groundbreaking, innovative and lifesaving redesign of humanitarian crisis response funding.
