  The Airbel Center is conducting a feasibility study of a market for
  large-scale displacement insurance to address that, in response to crises,
  humanitarian aid is often too little too late. This insurance would be taken
  out by key actors (such as host countries) with private insurers before crisis
  occurs, allowing for lifesaving capital to be dispersed significantly faster,
  as crises happen, rather than after.

In response to developing crisis, humanitarian aid is often too little, too late. Displacement insurance could address that, leading to more people people being saved, more cost-effectively. &nbsp;Airbel, in partnership with DFID, have co-organized a refugee finance innovation lab to facilitate discussions with key stakeholders [like?].

Similar to how disaster insurance is taken out on homes in areas at risk of natural disasters, Displacement insurance would work similarly, serving as host countries, humanitarian agencies, and donors. Airbel and DFID are presently conducting a feasibility study of a market for large-scale displacement insurance, and our research could lead to a groundbreaking, innovative and life saving redesign of humanitarian crisis response funding.
