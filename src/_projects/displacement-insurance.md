  The Airbel Center is conducting a feasibility study of a market for
  large-scale displacement insurance to address that, in response to crises,
  humanitarian aid is often too little too late. This insurance would be taken
  out by key actors (such as host countries) with private insurers before crisis
  occurs, allowing for lifesaving capital to be dispersed significantly faster,
  as crises happen, rather than after.
