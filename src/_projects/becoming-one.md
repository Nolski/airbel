  *Strengthening relationships to prevent violence against women*


  Humanitarian disasters leave affected populations with severe post-conflict
  trauma resulting in a myriad of mental health issues, high rates of poverty
  and reinforced gender inequality, under these circumstances, Intimate Partner
  Violence (IPV) becomes both systemic and pervasive.


  Becoming One is a counseling program designed to bring couples closer and
  prevent intimate partner violence. The program is delivered in partnership
  with local faith leaders, who guide couples through engaging workbooks and
  videos that teach communication skills, emotional regulation, shared control
  over finances and household duties, sexual consent and pleasure. Faith leaders
  connect these everyday behaviors to biblical principles to achieve lasting
  change.


  Becoming One aims to change behaviors, not just attitudes, to prevent partner
  violence through couples counseling delivered by local faith leaders in
  populations affected by protracted violent conflicts. Becoming One leverages
  an already existing and large social network, and faith leaders are equipped
  with engaging and instructional videos on counseling, while couples are
  provided with materials, such as guidebooks to practice techniques, such as
  anger management and joint financial decision making, at home.
