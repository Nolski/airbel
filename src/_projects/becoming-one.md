  Becoming One is a counseling program designed to bring couples closer and
  prevent intimate partner violence. The program is delivered in partnership
  with local faith leaders, who guide couples through engaging workbooks and
  videos that teach communication skills, emotional regulation, shared control
  over finances and household duties, sexual consent and pleasure.

Our process began by understanding the magnitude of the problem and how communities were solving it for themselves.

Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is the most common form of violence against women.

### **Becoming One helps couples build love in their relationship**

Our program relies on existing structures that the community appreciates and respects. In Uganda and many other east African countries, Christian couples are expected and highly motivated to attend pre-marital counseling programs at their local churches. These faith programs were identified during our research as a perfect contact point for preventing intimate partner violence for 3 main reasons:

1. Faith leaders are a trusted source of knowledge and advice, skilled in teaching and counseling;
2. Faith leaders spend a lot of time counseling couples through conflict and are highly incentivized to prevent violence as opposed to just respond to it;
3. Marriage and pre-marital counseling are frequently revenue sources for a church.
