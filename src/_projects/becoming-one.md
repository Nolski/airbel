Humanitarian disasters leave affected populations with severe post-conflict trauma resulting in a myriad of mental health issues, high rates of poverty and reinforced gender inequality, under these circumstances, Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) becomes both systemic and pervasive.

Becoming One, in partnership with Innovations for Poverty Action and World Vision, is a counseling program designed to bring couples closer and prevent intimate partner violence. The program is delivered in partnership with local faith leaders, who guide couples through engaging workbooks and videos that teach communication skills, emotional regulation, shared control over finances and household duties, sexual consent and pleasure. Faith leaders connect these everyday behaviors to biblical principles to achieve lasting change.

Becoming One aims to change behaviors, not just attitudes, to prevent partner violence through couples counseling delivered by local faith leaders in populations affected by protracted violent conflicts. Becoming One leverages an already existing and large social network, and faith leaders are equipped with engaging and instructional videos on counseling, while couples are provided with materials, such as guidebooks to practice techniques, such as anger management and joint financial decision making, at home.
