#Apply for Support from the IRC Innovation Fund
##What is it?
The Innovation Fund provides flexible funding toward the development of innovative products, services or systems. Investments from the Innovation fund may support projects at any stage of maturity but should be catalytic in nature.

The Innovation Fund enables the kind of creativity, curiosity and risk-taking that are made difficult by stringent reporting requirements and donor restrictions.

##Apply now!
Fill out one of the forms below to apply for an investment from the Innovation Fund. Requests of any amount will be considered.

##What's in scope
There’s no one recipe for an innovation project, but your project may be eligible if:

* You want to explore an idea that you find promising.

* You have an early-stage idea in need of further development;

* You have an idea about how to improve on best practice, at scale;

* You have developed a solution with the potential to improve on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness crisis-affected people;

* You have developed a solution that addresses humanitarian needs that are currently going unmet;

* You have an idea about how to change the way business is done in the humanitarian sector;

##What's not in scope
* Long-term core staff outside the scope of the programming or innovation identified in the request. The Innovation Fund can fund any costs associated with the development of new solutions, but is not meant fund long-term core staffing. 

* Solutions with no potential to scale. Applicants don’t need to have a fully articulated vision for scale in order to apply for funding. However, the Innovation Fund is not for localized solutions or solutions that are completely context-specific. 

* Solutions that will take longer than 5 years to validate.

* Solutions that could be funded through traditional humanitarian funding mechanisms.

* Technological solutions in search of problems.
