# Introduction

## What is this document?
The Airbel Playbook answers key questions about who we are, what we do, how we do it, and why. It's a useful introduction to our philosophy, culture, approach, and structure. It's also a good refresher for long-time staff and colleagues. Importantly, the Playbook is a one-stop shop for all our most important policy documentation. If you are looking for specific information about how we make decisions, run our projects, and structure our staffing, you can find it all here. If something is missing, or you aren't sure what to search for, you can share your feedback at airbel@rescue.org.

It's divided into four main sections: manifesto, deciding what to work on, our projects, and the department. At the end you can also find key resources and a glossary.

## Who is it for?
The Airbel Playbook was created with 3 key audience groups in mind: Airbel, the IRC more broadly, and, to a lesser extent, donors and partners.

#Section 1: Manifesto

##What does Airbel do? What is our goal?
###IRC mission
The International Rescue Committee was founded in 1936 to help people affected by conflict and disaster to survive, recover and gain control of their future. 

###Airbel mission
The mission of the Airbel Center is to *design*, *test*, and *scale* life-changing solutions (products, services and delivery systems) for people in crisis

##How do we envision our work changing the world?
The [Airbel Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d7xDSNa0Upd4POtqe0jbm8YoGVsSvbzi8BE2QaSve44/edit?usp=sharing) highlights the way in which we go about achieving our mission, and describes the world we'd like to see as a result of these efforts.

##What is the Airbel culture? What do we value?
The Airbel culture is one which values going beyond our comfort zone, with taking the time to fully consider ideas and to allow ourselves to exhibit childlike curiosity while also implementing with a focus on results. Our [Draft Values Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PWWglC37-lbuCS0BQARFECUotCHCDt8gtY7XSILIPQk/edit?usp=sharing) describes our values in detail. 

They are:
* Going one step beyond the comfort zone

* Generosity

* Results-driven

* Optimism

* Curiosity

#Section 2: Deciding what to work on
##How do we come up with ideas?
Airbel sources its ideas in different ways. Currently, work is underway to develop a comprehensive guide to generating effective new ideas - what we call "the bottom of the pipeline". While a lot of ideas come from within the Airbel team, and the broader team at IRC Headquarters in New York, we are working with our field colleagues to increasingly work on ideas that come from the field - much closer to the problems we are working on.

For example, our Middle East regional hub is sourcing ideas from the region. [*Mahali lab*](https://medium.com/airbel/mahali/home) plays a key role in this effort.

*Solution Surge* is an initiative through which the IRCâ€™s Airbel Team aims to introduce various human-centred design methods to IRC country teams, as an opportunity for collaborative skills-building. Ideas for potential future development will be build through a series of sprints in interested countries.

##How can I propose a project?
Currently, requests for resources can be made through the Airbel Investment Request protocol. This will be refined alongside development of the R&D fund and relevant governance procedures.

##How does Airbel evaluate project ideas and decide where to invest?
Airbel has a portfolio governance approach which focuses on transparency and accountability, diversified risk, vision & scale, flexibility with clear outcomes, and strategic prioritizagtion.

The three main components of our governance approach are: 
1. The Quarterly Review Process
2. Stage Gages
3. Advisory Network

These three components are outlined in full in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can read the [full governance document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#Section 3: Our projects

##What are the steps we take to design and test ideas, products, or projects?
As your project moves through the pipeline, project leads and designers are likely to require 
This includes both [step-by-step overviews](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rojab1AS6THP5oFZn_a56A7ljDX_-Fjxx5oBWFXezp4/edit?usp=sharing) of what steps to take when, as well as a comprehensive set of [examples of tools and processes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jxuNb-JvZzSWOccpVDrTH99jXuv5nMS9NkB5CB9EmX8/edit?usp=sharing) which can be used.

##How do we check in on projects to make course corrections?
Each month, an [operational check-in](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnzrU9iaOFl6uEqy82MQsOW-B989k-vmvYv1KE9xZTY/edit?usp=sharing) is held to get a good picture of pipeline health. 

##How do we decide whether to continue projects?
The governance approach dictates that review meetings be held on a quarterly basis, while stage gate meetings will take base on an ad hoc basis. These meetings are a space to make decisions around next steps for each investment.


##What measurements do we use to define success?
The Airbel Department measures success with a [set of Key Progress Indicators (KPI)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vldapYqg0zU5vVI8fXzuohJJrLFgVQAGJfgadG7l1w/edit?usp=sharing), which cover the innovation process, operational excellence, and the impact of our work.

##How does Airbel bring in outside expertise?
The Airbel Advisory Network provides intellectual and strategic guidance to Airbel with the objective of improving the quality, rigor and imagination of the Airbel portfolio. The Network serves to ensure that all of our projects are set up to successfully scale beyond their current scopes through private sector exits, government policy or other avenues.

The Network will be composed of researchers, innovators, private sector leaders, practitioners and policy-makers and will serve as an intellectually engaging space to shape the innovations launched, implemented and scaled at Airbel.

You can find more details on the Advisory Network in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

##How do we scale projects?
Guidance on scale is forthcoming

#Section 4: The Department
##How do we evaluate our work and ensure we're generating impact?
On a regular basis, projects are evaluated through the [quarterly review process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing). Through the quarterly review process, the Senior Management Team takes the opportunity to reflect on accomplishments and challenges from the past quarter, provide an overview of the portfolio and deparmtne, and update on finances and fundraising. You can view an [example from Q1 of FY19 here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/153CF4_Vs8bA6E3_ppcKfUIQ1mgn-WhEXuw3f1r9Y-rw/edit?usp=sharing).

##How are we structured?
You can learn more about this in the [Airbel structure document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rB6g8pesuEVyoeTMX6xFz-KlgJ2RT6gBb5D8NgbNwkw/edit?usp=sharing), which outlines the org chart, roles and responsibilities of the Senior Management Team, 

##What is the Airbel Board?
The Airbel Board provides key support and oversight. Additional details on the makeup of the board and its functions are forthcoming.

##How does Airbel ensure diversity and inclusion?
Airbel has assembled a working group on diversity and inclusion and has begun discussing the way forward for this area of work. Additional details are forthcoming.

##How does Airbel manage human resources?
Airbel human resources are managed in accordance with [IRC policies and structures](https://rescuenet.rescue.org/interact/Pages/Section/Default.aspx?Section=3112). Additional guidance is forthcoming.
