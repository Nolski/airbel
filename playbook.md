#Part 1: Manifesto
The Airbel Playbook answers key questions about who we are, what we do, how we do it, and why. For those new to Airbel, it introduces our philosophy, culture, approach, and structure. For long-time staff and colleagues, it can serve as a refresher or a reference.

Importantly, the Playbook is a one-stop shop for our most important policy documents. If you are looking for specific information about how we make decisions, run projects, and structure staffing, you can find it all here. If something is missing, or you aren't sure what to search for, you can share your feedback at airbel@rescue.org.

The Airbel Playbook was created mainly for Airbel staff, IRC colleagues, and, in some cases, donors and partners.

##What does Airbel do? What is our goal?
###IRC mission
The International Rescue Committee was founded in 1936 to help people affected by conflict and disaster to survive, recover and gain control of their future.

###Airbel mission
The mission of the Airbel Center is to *design*, *test*, and *scale* life-changing solutions (products, services and delivery systems) for people in crisis

##What principles guide Airbel's work?
Airbel is at its core multidisciplinary. It brings together a variety of disciplines, including human-centered design, behavioral science, academic research, and strategy to solve challenging problems in the humanitarian sector.

The following principles guide our approach and work: 

* Maintain a bias to action and push to prototyping quickly 

* Build on existing knowledge and research 

* Focus on usability and engagement

* Be ambitious about scale and cost-effectiveness

* Collaborate with colleagues from other disciplines

#Section 2: Deciding what to work on
##How do we come up with ideas?
Airbel sources its ideas in different ways. We're currently working to formalize this process. At the moment we have three main channels for our ideas:

1. Identifying big problem areas or opportunities for innovation through evidence review and design research

2. Identifying big hunches or hypotheses from experts, advisors, and trends scanning

3. Identifying big challenges faced by country programs and users

While a lot of ideas come from within the Airbel team, and the broader team at IRC Headquarters in New York, we are working with our field colleagues to increasingly work on ideas that come from the field - much closer to the problems we are working on.

For example, our Middle East regional hub is sourcing ideas from the region. [*Mahali lab*](https://medium.com/airbel/mahali/home) plays a key role in this effort.

##How can I propose a project?
Currently, requests for resources can be made through the [Airbel Investment Request protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k2YEdWixylbz_ogLvSfd8k6e7VsL1615g86pKYcLzSY/edit?usp=sharing). This will be refined alongside development of the R&D fund and relevant governance procedures.

##How does Airbel evaluate project ideas and decide where to invest?
Airbel has a portfolio governance approach which focuses on transparency and accountability, diversified risk, vision & scale, flexibility with clear outcomes, and strategic prioritizagtion.

The main components of our governance approach are: 

1. The Quarterly Review Process

2. Stage Gages

3. Advisory Network

These three components are outlined in full in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can read the [full governance document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#Section 3: Our projects
##What tools do we have for designing, testing, and scaling solutions?
Based on best practice and Airbel experience, we have compiled a set of tools which can be used to facilitate solutions as they move through the pipeline.

###Design
We develop ideas by drawing on three sources of information: 1) understanding the context and user journeys; 2) understanding the evidence base; 3) finding inspiration from solutions to analogous problems. We aim to make ideas concrete as quickly as possible by prototyping.

* **[Research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jxuNb-JvZzSWOccpVDrTH99jXuv5nMS9NkB5CB9EmX8/edit?usp=sharing)**  

* **[Generate solutions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p5ZISUKXV3nVlzOKouq5lggZDaDBVXfCYwiFTNwh-MQ/edit?usp=sharing)**

* **[Prototype](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mfognFa3vW1fVgWUTyZSGC5xd5x5aRSQ8zzk1kI5AeM/edit?usp=sharing)**

###Test
After learning about the desirability and feasibility of an idea, we pilot and test our solutions. During the initial pilot, we continue to tweak and refine the solution, before more piloting more rigorously, often at greater scale.

* **Pilot (forthcoming)**

* **Rigorous Evaluation (forthcoming)**

###Scale
We consider whether the idea is cost-efficient & simple enough to scale from the outset, as well as pathways to scale.

* **Scale (forthcoming)**

##How do we check in on projects to make course corrections?
Each month, an [operational check-in](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnzrU9iaOFl6uEqy82MQsOW-B989k-vmvYv1KE9xZTY/edit?usp=sharing) is held to get a good picture of pipeline health. 

##How do we decide whether to continue projects?
Strategic reviews are held of the full portfolio and department on a quarterly basis, which provides the opportunity for regular decision-making on how to pursue or move forward on different opportunities. Formal decision-making around next steps for projects takes place during stage gate meetings which are scheduled based upon the project's progress. More details are available in the [governance document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

###Stage Gate FAQ
####How often do we hold stage gates?
Stage gates are held when needed.
 
####When do I need to go through a stage gate?
As soon as there is substantial work being put into a project we should put it through stage gate 0. This is an initial endorsement to determine whether an idea, hypothesis, or solution should enter our portfolio. Ideally, you should go through stage gate 0 before any in-depth identification work.

####One a project is in the portfolio, Stage Gate 1 should happen before the design process begins (still pretty early on in the process). The project should go through stage gate 1 before beginning the design process. Stage gate 2 should come before piloting or evaluation. And finally, Stage Gate 3 should take place before we start thinking about scale.
 
####How can I get a stage gate for the project I’m leading?
Consult this document and fill in the relevant form for Stage Gate 0, Stage Gate 1, Stage Gate 2, or Stage Gate 3. Then set up a meeting with the Airbel Senior Management Team. For Stage Gates 2 and 3, there will be a second meeting held with internal and/or external stakeholders.
 
####Which projects go through stage gates?
All projects should be going through stage gates! That said, different projects will move forward differently depending on the availability of partners and funding. There are some times where projects may originate from donors or other actors, and therefore the decision-making process could differ from projects which originate from within the Airbel team.
 
####What are the criteria for passing a stage gate?
These differ depending which Stage Gate you’re going through, but always refer back to our [Airbel project criteria](). Generally, we look at potential for impact, scale, and cost-efficiency, as well as fit in portfolio. At later stages, scalability becomes more and more important. Generally projects are mapped against our Airbel project criteria. 

##What measurements do we use to define success?
The Airbel Department measures success with a [set of Key Progress Indicators (KPI)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vldapYqg0zU5vVI8fXzuohJJrLFgVQAGJfgadG7l1w/edit?usp=sharing), which cover the innovation process, operational excellence, and the impact of our work.

Specific indicators exist for the different projects in our portfolio.

##How does Airbel bring in outside expertise?
The Airbel Advisory Network provides intellectual and strategic guidance to Airbel with the objective of improving the quality, rigor and imagination of the Airbel portfolio. The Network serves to ensure that all of our projects are set up to successfully scale beyond their current scopes through private sector exits, government policy or other avenues.

The Network will be composed of researchers, innovators, private sector leaders, practitioners and policy-makers and will serve as an intellectually engaging space to shape the innovations launched, implemented and scaled at Airbel.

You can find more details on the Advisory Network in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

##How do we scale projects?
Guidance on scale is forthcoming

#Section 4: The Department
##How do we evaluate our work and ensure we're generating impact?
On a regular basis, projects are evaluated through the [quarterly review process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing). Through the quarterly review process, the Senior Management Team takes the opportunity to reflect on accomplishments and challenges from the past quarter, provide an overview of the portfolio and deparmtne, and update on finances and fundraising. You can view an [example from Q1 of FY19 here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/153CF4_Vs8bA6E3_ppcKfUIQ1mgn-WhEXuw3f1r9Y-rw/edit?usp=sharing).

##How are we structured?
You can learn more about this in the [Airbel structure document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rB6g8pesuEVyoeTMX6xFz-KlgJ2RT6gBb5D8NgbNwkw/edit?usp=sharing), which outlines the org chart, roles and responsibilities of the Senior Management Team, 

##What is the Airbel Board?
The Airbel Board provides key support and oversight. Additional details on the makeup of the board and its functions are forthcoming.

##How does Airbel ensure diversity and inclusion?
Airbel has assembled a working group on diversity and inclusion and has begun discussing the way forward for this area of work. Additional details are forthcoming.

##How does Airbel manage human resources?
Airbel human resources are managed in accordance with [IRC policies and structures](https://rescuenet.rescue.org/interact/Pages/Section/Default.aspx?Section=3112). Additional guidance is forthcoming.
