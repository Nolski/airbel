## Who is it for?
The Airbel Playbook was created with 3 key audience groups in mind: Airbel, the IRC more broadly, and, to a lesser extent, donors and partners.

#Section 1: Manifesto

##What does Airbel do? What is our goal?
###IRC mission
The International Rescue Committee was founded in 1936 to help people affected by conflict and disaster to survive, recover and gain control of their future. 

###Airbel mission
The mission of the Airbel Center is to design, test, and scale life-changing solutions (products, services and delivery systems) for people in crisis

##How do we envision our work changing the world?
The [Airbel Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d7xDSNa0Upd4POtqe0jbm8YoGVsSvbzi8BE2QaSve44/edit?usp=sharing) highlights the way in which we go about achieving our mission, and describes the world we'd like to see as a result of these efforts.

##What is the Airbel culture? What do we value?
The Airbel culture is one which values going beyond our comfort zone, with taking the time to fully consider ideas and to allow ourselves to exhibit childlike curiosity while also implementing with a focus on results. Our [Draft Values Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PWWglC37-lbuCS0BQARFECUotCHCDt8gtY7XSILIPQk/edit?usp=sharing) describes our values in detail:
-One step beyond the comfort zone
-Respect and generosity
-Results-driven
-Optimism
-Curiosity

Currently, the values document is available in Google Docs. In the future, it will be made available in other forms.

#Section 2: Deciding what to work on
##How do we come up with ideas?
Bottom of the pipeline
Solution Surge
Hubs

##How can I propose a project?
Currently, requests for resources can be made through the Airbel Investment Request protocol. This will be refined alongside development of the R&D fund and relevant governance procedures.

##How does Airbel evaluate project ideas and decide where to invest?
Airbel has a portfolio governance approach which focuses on transparency and accountability, diversified risk, vision & scale, flexibility with clear outcomes, and strategic prioritizagtion.
The three main components of our governance approach is: the Quarterly Review Process, Stage Gages, and Advisory Network. These three components are outlined in full in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can read the [full governance document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Investments are made via two routes: the R&D fund and through regular investment requests. The R&D fund is in p

#Section 3: Our projects

##What are the steps we take to design and test ideas, products, or projects?
As your project moves through the pipeline, project leads and designers are likely to require 
This includes both [step-by-step overviews](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rojab1AS6THP5oFZn_a56A7ljDX_-Fjxx5oBWFXezp4/edit?usp=sharing) of what steps to take when, as well as a comprehensive set of [examples of tools and processes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jxuNb-JvZzSWOccpVDrTH99jXuv5nMS9NkB5CB9EmX8/edit?usp=sharing) which can be used.

##How do we check in on projects to make course corrections?
Each month, an [operational check-in](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnzrU9iaOFl6uEqy82MQsOW-B989k-vmvYv1KE9xZTY/edit?usp=sharing) is held to get a good picture of pipeline health. 

##How do we decide whether to continue projects?
The governance approach dictates that review meetings be held on a quarterly basis, while stage gate meetings will take base on an ad hoc basis. These meetings are a space to make decisions around next steps for each investment.


##What measurements do we use to define success?

##How does Airbel bring in outside expertise?
The Airbel Advisory Network provides intellectual and strategic guidance to Airbel with the objective of improving the quality, rigor and imagination of the Airbel portfolio. The Network serves to ensure that all of our projects are set up to successfully scale beyond their current scopes through private sector exits, government policy or other avenues.

The Network will be composed of researchers, innovators, private sector leaders, practitioners and policy-makers and will serve as an intellectually engaging space to shape the innovations launched, implemented and scaled at Airbel.

You can find more details on the Advisory Network in the [Airbel Portfolio Governance Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFEU7u67W0CZdzrsoZXGnfT8qUjsfvzlFrFvjzFWKuQ/edit?usp=sharing)
